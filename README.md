    I made a game to allow a user to play Rock, Paper and Sissors against the Computer. The user could write rock or paper or scissors and will be able
		to see the opponent move. Also, the user will see a record of how many games, wins, losses and ties in each game. The user can play as many times as 
		he wants and to exit the user has to write quit. At the end the user will se a a message if he won more times to lost, 
		lost more times to won or won and lost equal number of games.
